            == ParaVM: Parallella Virtual Machine ==

                -- Compatibility --

ParaVM is written in Clang-flavored C11 and requires Clang 3.3+. The build
system is written with Autotools and so requires Autoconf, Automake, etc.

The following libraries are required to build:

* (e)glibc (libc, libm, libdl, libpthread)
* eSDK (libe_host)
* ICU (libicui18n, libicuuc, libicudata)

ParaVM is mainly meant to be built directly on a Parallella board (or some
other ARM board with Epiphany accelerator cores), but there's no particular
reason that cross-compiling it wouldn't work.

ParaVM only runs on ARM systems with an ARMv7 or better CPU. Additionally,
it requires at least one Epiphany accelerator core to function. The only
supported operating system is Linux.
