            == ParaVM: Parallella Virtual Machine ==

                -- Compatibility --

ParaVM is written in Clang-flavored C11 and requires Clang 3.3+. The build
system is written with Autotools and so requires Autoconf, Automake, etc.

The following libraries are required to build:

* (e)glibc (libc, libm, libdl, libpthread)
* BlocksRuntime (libBlocksRuntime)
* GLib (libglib-2.0)
* GMP (libgmp)
* editline (libedit)
* libffi (libffi)
* Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC (libgc)

The following libraries are required for Epiphany support:

* eSDK (libe-hal)

If the eSDK is not present, ParaVM will be compiled in emulation mode, in
which case only the emulator is available. If you need JIT compiler support,
be sure to compile with the eSDK.

The only supported operating system is Linux.
