                -- Installation --

ParaVM uses a fairly standard build system based on Autotools. If you're
building from Git, do the typical:

    $ autoreconf -f -i
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=/opt/paravm
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

If you're cross-compiling, you'll want to skip the make check command. If
you're building from a tarball, you can skip the autoreconf command.
