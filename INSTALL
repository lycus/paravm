            == ParaVM: Parallella Virtual Machine ==

                -- Installation --

ParaVM uses a fairly standard build system based on Autotools. If you're
building from Git, do the typical:

    $ autoreconf -f -i
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=/opt/paravm
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

If you're cross-compiling, you'll want to skip the make check command. If
you're building from a tarball, you can skip the autoreconf command.

Note that if you're building with the JIT compiler, ParaVM will need to
install a helper module into the Linux kernel. This module exposes a
superuser-only character device (/dev/paravm) used to allocate persistent
physical memory from the kernel. ParaVM uses this to reserve memory that
Epiphany accelerator cores can then use reliably.

The kernel module is built separately, following standard out-of-tree kernel
module practices:

    $ cd paravm/linux
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo modprobe paravm

To upgrade the kernel module at a later time, do:

    $ cd paravm/linux
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo modprobe -r paravm
    $ sudo modprobe paravm

Only do this when no ParaVM processes are running.
