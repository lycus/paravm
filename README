            == ParaVM: Parallella Virtual Machine ==

                -- Introduction --

ParaVM is a virtual machine written specifically for the Epiphany processor
achitecture. More specifically, it is meant to run on a host ARM system
where it compiles code (in a JIT fashion) to Epiphany machine code that is
executed on Epiphany accelerator cores in an isolated fashion similar to
the concurreny model employed by Erlang. One such system is the Parallella
board which ParaVM is primarily written for.
